A premium add-on to The Events Calendar plugin (required), enabling recurrence, custom attributes, venue pages, new widgets and more.

== Description ==

<a href="https://evnt.is/3r">Events Calendar PRO</a> is a awesomely dynamic add-on for The Events Calendar that adds more features and functionality to an already robust plugin.

The Events Calendar allows you to create and manage events with ease from right within your WordPress dash; no shortcode is needed (nor is one available).  With Events Calendar PRO, you can go even further with recurring events, more calendar views (including Day and Week), Location Search, more widget options, and much more.

Plus, Events Calendar PRO users get access to our premium support forums. Need help or have a question? Post there and we'll get back to you within 24 hours (during the week). We're proud of our great support team and want to help you crush it with Events Calendar PRO.

= Features =

The following lists the PRO-only features. For a list of The Events Calendar features, check out that plugin's readme.txt or check out <a href="https://evnt.is/3s">the Product page</a>.

Just getting started? You'll want to watch and read through the <a href="https://evnt.is/3t">New User Primer</a>.

* Advanced Views: Day, Week, Map, Photo
* Venue and Organizer Pages
* Recurring Events
* Location Search
* Advanced Widgets: Advanced Upcoming Event List, Countdown, Calendar, Venue
* Related Events listing
* Custom Fields
* iCal and Google Calendar download
* Default Content
* Premium Forum access & support

== Installation ==

Remember, to use Events Calendar PRO you need to also be running The Events Calendar. You'll need to follow these steps for both plugins, starting with The Events Calendar.

1. From the dashboard of your site, navigate to Plugins --> Add New.
2. Select the Upload option and hit "Choose File."
3. When the popup appears select the the-events-calendar-x.x.zip file or events-calendar-pro-x.x.zip file from your desktop. (The 'x.x' will change depending on the current version number).
4. Follow the on-screen instructions and wait as the upload completes.
5. When it's finished, activate the plugin via the prompt. A message will show confirming activation was successful. A link to access the calendar directly on the frontend will be presented here as well.
6. For access to new updates, make sure you have added your valid License Key under Events --> Settings --> Licenses. You can find your license key on your tri.be account at https://evnt.is/3u.

That's it! Just configure your settings as you see fit, and you're on your way to creating events in style.

= Requirements =

* PHP 5.6 or greater (recommended: PHP 7.0 or greater)
* WordPress 4.9 or above
* jQuery 1.11.x
* The Events Calendar 5.0 or newer

= Where to Begin =

If this is your first time using The Events Calendar and Events Calendar PRO, you're in for a treat! Here are some basics we've found helpful for users jumping into it for the first time:

* Our <a href="https://evnt.is/3t">New User Primer</a> was designed for folks in your exact position. Featuring both step-by-step videos and written walkthroughs that feature accompanying screenshots, the primer aims to take you from zero to hero in no time.
* <a href="https://evnt.is/3v">Installation/Setup FAQs</a> from our Support page can help give an overview of what the plugin can and cannot do. This section of the FAQs may be helpful as it aims to address any basic install questions not addressed by the new user primer.
* <a href="https://evnt.is/9u">Tutorials</a>, based on commonly-requested hacks and tweaks, which will provide you guidance towards accomplishing some highly sought-after tweaks.
* Are you a developer looking to build a custom frontend view? We created an example plugin that demonstrates how to register a new view. You can download the plugin at GitHub here: https://github.com/moderntribe/tribe-events-agenda-view
* Take care of your license key. Though not required to create your first event, you'll want to get it in place as soon as possible to guarantee your access to support and upgrades. Need help finding your license key? Check out https://evnt.is/3w

Otherwise, if you're feeling adventurous, you can get started by heading to the Events menu and adding your first event.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is there a shortcode available for Events Calendar PRO? +

No, this plugin does not use a shortcode nor is one available at the time being.

= Are there any troubleshooting steps you'd suggest I try that might resolve my issue before I post a new thread? =

First, make sure that you're running the latest version of The Events Calendar (4.0 as of this release). If you're running Events Calendar PRO it needs to match the version number of The Events Calendar. And if you've got any other add-ons, make sure those are current / running the latest code as well.

The most common issues we see are either plugin or theme conflicts. You
can test if a plugin or theme is conflicting by manually deactivating other plugins until just The Events Calendar 4.0 is running on your site. If the issue persists from there, revert to the default Twenty Twelve theme. If the issue is resolved after deactivating a specific plugin or your theme, you'll know that is the source of the conflict.

Note that we aren't going to say "tough luck" if you identify a plugin/theme conflict. While we can't guarantee 100% integration with any plugin or theme out there, we will do our best (and reach out the plugin/theme author as needed) to figure out a solution that benefits everyone.

= I'm still stuck. Where do I go to file a bug or ask a question? =

If you're already a PRO user, you're entitled access to our more actively-monitored <a href="https://evnt.is/3x">PRO forums</a> at the theeventscalendar.com website. We can provide a deeper level of support here and hit these forums on a daily basis during the work week. No post should go more than 24-hours during that time without a response.

= What add-ons are available for The Events Calendar and Events Calendar PRO, and where can I read more about them? =

Currently, the following add-ons are available for The Events Calendar/Events Calendar PRO:

* <a href="https://evnt.is/18wi">Events Calendar PRO</a>, for adding premium calendar features like recurring events, advanced views, cool widgets, shortcodes, additional fields, and more!
* <a href="https://evnt.is/18wj">Event Tickets</a> (free), which allows you to collect RSVPs to events. It can run alongside The Events Calendar or as a standalone plugin that adds RSVP functionality to WordPress posts and pages.
* <a href="https://evnt.is/18wk">Event Tickets Plus</a>, which allows you to sell tickets for your events using your favorite e-commerce platform.
* <a href="https://evnt.is/2g">Community Events</a>, for allowing frontend event submission from your readers.
* <a href="https://evnt.is/18wl">Community Tickets</a>, which allows event organizers to sell tickets to the events they submit via Community Events.
* <a href="https://evnt.is/2h">Facebook Events</a>, for importing events directly from an organization or page on Facebook.
* <a href="https://evnt.is/fa">Filter Bar</a>, for adding advanced frontend filtering capabilities to your events calendar.
* <a href="https://evnt.is/18h9">iCal Importer</a>, for importing events any iCal feed or ICS file.
* <a href="https://evnt.is/2e">Eventbrite Tickets</a>, for selling tickets to your event directly through Eventbrite.

= I have a feature idea. What's the best way to tell you about it? =

We've got a <a href="https://tribe.uservoice.com/forums/195723-feature-ideas">The Events Calendar UserVoice page</a> where we're actively watching for feature ideas from the community. Vote up existing feature requests or add your own, and help us shape the future of the products business in a way that best meets the community's needs.

= I've still got questions. Do you have a bigger FAQ somewhere? =

We do. If you check out our a href="https://evnt.is/41">Frequently Asked Questions page</a> on the tri.be site, we've collected and addressed all of the common questions we see posed by users. In some cases we'll provide a Gist; in other cases we'll direct you to a tutorial; and in some situations we'll unfortunately say a certain capability is simply not possible. But the FAQ is a living, breathing document that we're actively updating based on commonly-seen requests.

== Help ==

Welcome to The Events Calendar and Events Calendar PRO, a full-featured events management system for WordPress. Thank you so much for using the labor of our love. We are The Events Calendar and we are here to help you be awesome.

If you aren't familiar with The Events Calendar and Events Calendar PRO, check out our <a href="https://evnt.is/3t">new user primer.</a> It'll introduce you to the basics of what the plugin has to offer and will have you creating events in no time. From there, the resources below -- extensive template tag documentation, FAQs, video walkthroughs and more -- will give you a leg up as you dig deeper.

Additional resources available include:

* <a href="https://evnt.is/42">Documentation</a>

* <a href="https://evnt.is/4c">Help Videos</a>

* <a href="https://evnt.is/3x">Forums</a>

We hit the <a href="https://evnt.is/3x">premium forums</a> daily during the week to help paid users with site integration, minor customization, troubleshooting, and more.

Some things to consider before posting on the forum:

* Look through existing threads before posting a new one and check that there isn't already a discussion going on your issue.
* Your issue will be solved more quickly if you run a few checks before making a support request. Deactivate your plugins one by one - if the issue is fixed by deactivating a plugin you know you've got a plugin conflict. To test your Theme, revert to the default Twenty Twelve Theme to see if you are still experiencing the problem. If not, your Theme is the issue. Please provide this information when making your supper request.
* Sometimes, just resetting your permalinks can fix the issue. Visit Events -> Settings -> Permalinks, save your permalinks with a different option and then save with your preferred choice again. This can solve events-related problems and can is worth a shot before creating a new thread.

Still not happy? Shoot us an email to pro@tri.be or tweet to @moderntribeinc and tell us why. We'll do what we can to make it right.
