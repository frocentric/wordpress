# About this project

Spintax is a compact notation that allows you to embed multiple variants of text within one string, for example `Hello {world|World|dear Customer}`. **ChillDev Spintax** is a library that allows you to operate in a convieniant way on such texts both in terms of processing texts written with spintax and encapsulating them - everything in an objective way.
